    <h1>Start your Chiropractic practice</h1>
       <p>We’re looking to invest in the best chiropractic associates to build sustainable practices for years to come. No flips. No fast exits. No unfair terms. We’re in it for the long-haul. </p>

   <h2>notes</h2>
    <p>
    Our differed: We don’t love the basic investment model of giving a bunch of money and loading the chiropractor with the burden of doing everything. We’re two leading strategists in our field turned investors and created a better system. We put the details into this website. If any of it sounds interesting, please reach out. We’re currently interviewing chiropractors as we speak and looking to connect with more.

Paper napkin sketch -

This, of course, is an oversimplified example meant to clearly illustrate our intentions and whether or not you’d be interested in this style of growth.

 We make a partnership - all based on need, the deal, cost, etc. But you’re an owner, regardless of split
We buy a practice together - We (the investors) will take 100% financial burden. We have cash ready to inject + willing to handle any potential financing needed. Like I said, we’re all in.
Wait - you said buy a practice? Yep. this will be strategic, and something we discuss together. Your current boss is retiring? Maybe we can transition the business. You’re a diversified practitioner? Let’s look for a similar match. We like the acquisition model vs building from scratch because we can be profitable from day 1, even with transitional churn, which we will strategically limit. This is just our starting point and the next steps are vital
You hit the ground running - you’ll be compensated by salary + ownership bonus to start. We don’t want you worried about your mortgage. We want you focused on giving great healthcare, caring about the patients and community, and growing our client list.
As we pay off debt, you get more ownership equity - simple as it sounds. Get the business healthy and you take more ownership
Divide and conquer - simply put - you handle healthcare and patient growth, we handle the business and office growth
Rinse & repeat - you start training associates who want to own their branch and build repeatable protocol - we buy another practice, and you take ownership equity in every practice we do this.

Here’s why this is effective
Most SMB owners have to be everything to everyone. Ask any chiropractor. Most of their day is anything but providing healthcare. That doesn’t make any sense to us. Why would we have an MLB Allstar 3rd baseman trying to write Facebook ads code a website rather than play an Allstar 3rd base?

Let’s think numbers - if we can cut 40% of the things your aren’t great at out from your schedule, that means you have 40% more time to do what you’re great at. This gives more time to build a deeper client list, expand the practice offerings, be more involved in the community, which all in turn makes a healthier business.

Catch 22 right? We need all the marketing and advertising and software and business structure to have a healthy business all while not letting the business side get in the way of the business.

Oh, and did we mention our background is in business growth and operations for the most competitive industries in North America? We can help on all the areas which, frankly, you should not be doing.

This makes our partnership scalable.

Let’s cut to the chase -

We’re looking to partner with an entrepreneurial chiropractor who wants to run a successful chiropractic health center and then grow to multiple locations.

We have big plans and need a chiropractor who wants it too.

BUT for all of this to work, we need to focus entirely on Office #1.

Who were looking for:
advanced associates who may not need more training
Current owners looking to expand into another location (or more)
